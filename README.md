# OmaStats

A system monitor for the [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) bar, in the spirit of
Bjango's [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/): CPU, GPU, memory,
disk, network, temperatures, fans and battery stats at a glance. Compact readouts with
live mini graphs sit in the bar; clicking one opens a panel with history graphs,
ring gauges, sensors and the top processes, one tab per module. Everything it
shows, in the bar and in the panel, is configurable from inside the panel.

OmaStats is an independent project and is not affiliated with Bjango.

## Modules

| Module  | Bar readout                         | Panel                                                                 |
|---------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CPU     | glyph · user/system history · %     | User/system history, per-core rings, load, uptime, top processes |
| GPU     | one readout per GPU · history · %   | Its own tab, with aligned load and VRAM histories when reported |
| Memory  | glyph · used history · %            | Swap and memory rings, breakdown, processes                           |
| Disks   | per disk: read/write history and rates, space used | Volumes (click to open in Files), activity for all disks or one, processes |
| Network | glyph · up/down history · rates     | Upload/download, interfaces, public and local IPs, traffic per process |
| Sensors | any temperatures and fans you pick  | CPU/GPU/fan rings, every hwmon temperature and fan                    |
| Battery | glyph by level · %                  | Charge and health rings, charge history, power, cycles, peripherals   |

Battery and GPU only appear when the hardware exists. A machine with more than
one GPU gets a readout per card, each tagged in the bar (`NVD`, `AMD`, `INT`);
the Settings page picks which ones appear in the bar. The firmware boot display
leads, followed by the other cards in PCI address order. The GPU tab always
shows every detected card, including cards whose telemetry is unavailable.
Intel's i915/xe drivers publish no utilisation counter through sysfs, so an
Intel readout carries its clock and temperature and reports no load. Every read
of an awake AMD card restarts its runtime-suspend timer, so while such a card
can suspend, its load, clock, power and temperatures refresh once per
autosuspend delay (about six seconds by default) and it can still sleep when
idle. NVIDIA
cards remain visible when `nvidia-smi` is unavailable. Existing 1.0 tab settings
keep access to GPU details when upgrading; GPU can then be hidden separately.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/crmne/omastats.git --enable
```

Or by hand: copy this directory to `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/crmne.omastats/`, then
`omarchy plugin enable crmne.omastats`.

## Remove

```bash
omarchy plugin remove crmne.omastats
```

That disables the plugin and deletes its directory. By hand:
`omarchy plugin disable crmne.omastats`, then remove
`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/crmne.omastats/`. Nothing is written outside that
directory except this widget's own entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`,
which `omarchy plugin disable` removes.

## What it needs

The plugin runs one small sampler process that reads procfs and sysfs. Two
implementations ship with the same JSON protocol:

- `bin/omastats-sampler` — the Rust binary for x86-64, about 3 MB resident and 0.3% CPU.
- `bin/omastats-sampler-aarch64` — the Rust binary for ARM64 Linux, statically
  linked with musl so it does not need a particular glibc version.
  Both are built from `sampler/`. Their checksums, byte-for-byte reproducible
  builds, and signed GitHub attestations are documented in
  [BINARY_PROVENANCE.md](BINARY_PROVENANCE.md).
- `sampler.py` — a Python 3 fallback used whenever that binary is missing or
  cannot run here (another architecture, for instance). No third-party modules.

The service starts `/usr/bin/python3` in isolated mode with a cleared
environment. That entry point selects the Rust binary for the machine's
architecture and replaces itself with it, retaining the same process ID;
otherwise it continues as the
Python sampler. No shell participates in the runtime launch path. Every emitted
JSON record is capped before it reaches the shell's streaming parser, and the
sampler is explicitly stopped when the plugin service is destroyed.

Optional command-line tools, each used only for the feature named, and each
degrading to "unavailable" when missing: `nvidia-smi` (NVIDIA GPU readings;
AMD and Intel come from sysfs), `ip` and `iw` (addresses, Wi-Fi signal),
`ss` from iproute2 (per-process network traffic), `zfs` and `zpool` (a ZFS
pool's space and the drive behind its first data vdev, shown as one volume at
its shortest mount path; without them the space is that dataset's), `curl` (public IP lookup),
`wl-copy` (copy an address), `xdg-open` (open a volume in your file manager).

Nothing runs as root, and no data leaves the machine except the optional
public-IP lookup, which you can switch off in Settings. That lookup tries
`api.ipify.org`, `icanhazip.com`, then `ifconfig.me` over HTTPS and stops after
the first valid IP-address response.

`make` builds the native binary and checksum into `bin/`. On x86-64 Linux,
`make build-arm64` builds the portable ARM64 binary using a checksum-pinned
toolchain downloaded into `.cache/`; it needs Python 3.12+, a C linker and tar,
and does not change the system toolchain. `make verify-binary` checks two native
builds against the bundled artifact (using the pinned Arch environment for
x86-64); `make verify-arm64` does the same for the portable ARM64 build.
`make install` syncs the plugin into the Omarchy plugin directory.

## Configuring

Open the panel and click the gear at the right end of the tab strip (or press `s`).

- **Bar**: switch each module's readout on or off, order them with the arrows,
  and pick each one's look: a mini history graph, a fullness ring (CPU, GPU,
  memory, disk capacity, battery charge), a figure, or a graph or ring with the
  figure. Disks get a readout for each device you tick (or all disks together),
  each showing read/write speed, space used, or both; the Sensors readout
  shows whichever temperatures and fans you tick. GPU memory can get its own
  VRAM readout beside each selected GPU, drawn in the GPU readout's look. On a
  vertical bar each readout stacks its label across the bar, with the graph or
  ring and the figure under it; network and disk speeds show one rate per line,
  colored like their half of the graph.
- **Panel**: choose which tabs appear and which sections each page shows.
- **General**: temperature unit, refresh interval (0.1 s to 10 s), history span,
  bar graph width, optional utilization colors, and a reset.

Utilization colors are off by default. When enabled, they grade CPU, GPU load,
GPU memory, and system memory bar figures and graph samples. The GPU tab's load
and VRAM histories use the same grades. CPU, GPU load, GPU memory, system memory,
and disk capacity rings are graded too, along with disk capacity figures. The displayed
rounded percentage selects low below 25%, normal 25–59%,
warning 60–84%, or critical 85% and higher. Each grade accepts a `#RRGGBB`
color. Disk and network transfer rates, battery, sensors, and other panel graphs
and rings keep their theme colors. The default green, blue, orange, and red shades
adapt to light and dark bars and popups. A custom hex color stays fixed across
themes; clear its field to return to the theme-aware default.

Every process list has an **All** toggle that unfolds into every process with a
search field (`/` from anywhere in the panel), sorted by that page's column.

Changes are written to this widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`, so
they survive restarts and each bar instance keeps its own. The saved disk
selection and Speed / Used / Both choice are retained when the shell reloads
widget settings. The same keys can be edited there by hand or through

Several instances are allowed, so modules can be spread across the bar:

```json
{ "id": "crmne.omastats", "modules": "cpu,memory" },
{ "id": "crmne.omastats", "modules": "network", "networkStyle": "graph" }
```

## Interaction

- **Left click** a readout opens its page; clicking the same readout again closes the panel.
- **Right click** launches `btop`. **Middle click** refreshes the public IP.
- In the panel: `h`/`l` or `←`/`→` switch tabs, `1`–`7` jump to a tab, `s` opens
  Settings, `/` searches processes, `j`/`k` scroll, `Tab` moves to the neighbouring
  bar panel, `Esc` closes, `r` refreshes.
- Addresses on the Network page copy to the clipboard when clicked. Volumes on
  the Disks page open in the file manager.

The sampler reads cheap counters at the chosen interval and everything that
walks many files (processes, sensors, battery, socket mapping) at most once a
second, so 0.1 s refresh stays inexpensive. Per-process network traffic comes
from the kernel's per-socket TCP byte counters (the same ones `ss -ti` shows),
differenced once a second and tied to processes through `/proc`, so it needs no
root. UDP, and therefore QUIC, carries no such counters and is not attributed.

While the Memory page is open, its process list shows proportional set size
(PSS) instead of summed RSS, so an app made of many processes is charged for
its shared libraries once rather than once per process. PSS comes from
`/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup`, read every 3 s and never while the panel is closed
or on another page. Processes owned by other users cannot be read without root
and keep their RSS; rows that include them are dimmed.

IPC:

```bash
omarchy-shell crmne.omastats show sensors    # open on a tab (or "settings")
omarchy-shell crmne.omastats toggle network
omarchy-shell crmne.omastats hide
omarchy-shell crmne.omastats status          # JSON summary
```

## Design notes

By default, graph colours come from the active theme: the accent is the first
series and the theme colour furthest around the hue wheel (magenta, cyan or
blue preferred) is the second, so user/system, upload/download and read/write
always read as a pair in any theme. Warnings use the theme's yellow and red.
Text normally stays in the
theme foreground; the optional utilization colors apply to selected bar figures,
rings, and mini graphs. Other data keeps the theme palette and identity dots.

The tab strip gives every module an equal slot, the settings gear included, so
nothing shifts when you switch, and the panel sizes itself so every tab is
named in full. Abbreviations live only in the bar, where height is scarce:
the readouts stack the module's letters (CPU, MEM, DSK, NET) the way iStat
Menus labels its menubar items, with consistent device-pixel spacing between
letters on scaled displays, unless you prefer glyphs.

## Packaging maintenance

Release packaging uses the [native-packages](https://rubygems.org/gems/native-packages) gem. `native-packages.yaml` declares packages and downstream repositories; native recipes and installation assets live in `packaging/`; see [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md) for local commands and CI behavior.
